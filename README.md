MIPS Calculator Game 🧮🎮
📌 Overview

This project is a calculator game built in MIPS assembly language.
The program combines arithmetic functionality with game-like elements, reinforcing low-level programming concepts such as register usage, memory management, and control flow.

Players interact with the calculator through an ASCII-based interface, solving arithmetic problems while the game tracks their progress.

🚀 Features

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Input validation for correct numbers and operators

ASCII text-based interface for clear user interaction

Game mechanics:

Randomly generated arithmetic problems

Score tracking (correct vs. incorrect answers)

Win/lose conditions based on player performance

Modularized structure:

Input handling

Operation execution

Display/board updates

Game loop logic

🛠️ Technical Details

Language: MIPS Assembly

Simulator: MARS
